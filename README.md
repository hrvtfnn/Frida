# Frida The Hunting Dog
I am working on a website for a local hunter who tracks wounded animals with his dog buddy, Frida.

Fun fact about dachshunds: They are excellent scent dogs and are often used to track down wounded animals after car accidents, for example. The dachshund is also the only breed of dog to hunt both above and below ground.
